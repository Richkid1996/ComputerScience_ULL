    Assignment: Imagine you are a mathematician, and your goal is to make your calculations easier by placing common operations
    into reusable methods. In this instance, you want to define a method that automatically triples a number for you.
    Define a public static method called triple, which receives a single int as a parameter. The method should multiply
    the provided argument by 3 and return the result as an int.

    Assignment: Imagine you are a video game developer. You are working on a PvP Battle Royal game. Your specific focus is on
    the character "Jy Normus", a powerful barbarian that uses a club. Each character has their own special ability that can
    only be used when the power is fully charged. Jy Normus's special ability is called "Club Smash".
    You have created a method called clubSmash that executes this special ability. The method takes a single bool input
    to determine whether the character's power is fully charged and doesn't return anything. To test that it works as expected, call the method clubSmash and provide true as an input argument.
